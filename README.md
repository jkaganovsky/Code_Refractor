# HW01_Code_Refractor

## UW CODING BOOT CAMP HOMEWORK 01

## Summary
In this homework, I immediately found a number of redundancies and multiple layers of code that were either repetitive or simply unnecessary.

Hence, in order to make my html and css file more readable and accessible, I renamed most of the div tags and consolidated styles that were similar and grouped them together. This way, each tag is now with purpose and provides meaning.
